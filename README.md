# Twitter Integration

## Overview
This app lets you search for tweets with a certain keyword/query, and store them in a MySQL database. 
It requires a Twitter API key and a MySQL server.

In the future, it is planned for this app to be able to perform sentiment analysis and trend tracking on the collected tweets, as well as answer questions about them using a language model.

This app is powered by [EvaDB](https://github.com/georgia-tech-db/eva), a Python-based database system for AI applications developed by Georgia Tech's DB Group.

## Credts
This is forked from the work done by https://github.com/yulaicui/youtube_video_qa for EvaDB 0.2.14, for the purpose of obtaining a starting repository already compatible with and structured around EvaDB.

## Setup
Ensure that the local Python version is >= 3.8. Install the required libraries:

```bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run script: 
```bat
python run_evadb.py
```
